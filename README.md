# Hanoi Tower
## Description 
This interactive Hanoi tower walks through the steps of moving disks from one peg to another while obeying three rules: 
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3. No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
